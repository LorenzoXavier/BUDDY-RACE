## Background & Objectives

Buddy Game🏎. It's a simple game where you use your keyboard to make a buddy move forward. Each player will move their avatar by tapping a key (e.g. `g` for player one, `L` for player two)

The goal here is to learn more about JavaScript, the DOM, and asynchronous event handling.
